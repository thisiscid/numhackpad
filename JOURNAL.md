# First journal!
#### 7/4/25, 1:21 AM
So originally I was planning on doing a hackpad when i started this project but ended up going down a rabbit hole so its more like a numhackpad instead of a hackpad, it also uses a matrix now too, so yea. I made the schematic and routed and wired and stuff today! (this is literally my first hardware project please help i think im overstepping it </3)
but yea, not a hackpad anymore, its a numhackpad, should update the repo name but aaa im too lazy

# day 2!!

This time round I did some stuff with the case (and then undid it bcs i decided i needed to expand my pcb). I also added holes for standoffs + added art!
Also, new repo name wooo

# day 3!!

so now we have like standoff thingies to screw our pcb into! also redid the case fr, also did actual hole stuff, took me a bit. lwk kinda having fun though

new case! ^

went through a bunch of changes only to undo them and end up with roughly my original design ðŸ˜”

# wooo we're finished kind of! (probably if i didn't mess up the case)
#### 7/6/25, 12:08 AM

so i accidentally added one more key so we're removing the delete key for the sake of keeping it within hackpad guidelines, and so now its a 16 key numhackpad and it truly is terrible no good very bad! the top is finished, case is done, so yay! super cool! next up, firmware </3

# starting the firmware
#### 7/6/25, 1:16 PM

so for firmware i'm using kmk bcs `qmk setup` hangs. anyways idk if this is required, im still trying to figure out how to do the gpio pin declaration but it should be mostly complete. no images this time bcs its actual code sorry chat
off to lunch now

**total time spent**: 40m
