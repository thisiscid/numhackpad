# First journal!
#### 7/4/25, 1:21 AM
So originally I was planning on doing a hackpad when i started this project but ended up going down a rabbit hole so its more like a numhackpad instead of a hackpad, it also uses a matrix now too, so yea. I made the schematic and routed and wired and stuff today! (this is literally my first hardware project please help i think im overstepping it </3)
but yea, not a hackpad anymore, its a numhackpad, should update the repo name but aaa im too lazy

**total time spent**: 3 hrs

# wooo we're finished kind of! (probably if i didn't mess up the case)
#### 7/6/25, 12:08 AM

so i accidentally added one more key so we're removing the delete key for the sake of keeping it within hackpad guidelines, and so now its a 16 key numhackpad and it truly is terrible no good very bad! the top is finished, case is done, so yay! super cool! next up, firmware </3

# starting the firmware
#### 7/6/25, 1:16 PM

so for firmware i'm using kmk bcs `qmk setup` hangs. anyways idk if this is required, im still trying to figure out how to do the gpio pin declaration but it should be mostly complete. no images this time bcs its actual code sorry chat
off to lunch now

**total time spent**: 40m

# we're done!
#### 7/6/25, 5:13 PM

so now we're done! i added keycaps to the 3d model, did a bunch of organizing, and made a readme, so yay!
